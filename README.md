# Tech sessions repository
This repository contains a collection of tech sessions to introduce common technologies and tools for software development. The repository aims to provide a introduction to the technologies and tools needed to develop web applications. From backend to frontend, from databases to deployment, from testing to monitoring, from version control to continuous integration, from development to production.

## Standard web application flow
A web application is a software application that runs on a web server and consists of numerous technologies and tools. The standard web application flow is as follows:
1. **Frontend**: The frontend is the user interface of the web application. It is the part of the web application that users interact with. The frontend is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The frontend is responsible for rendering the user interface and handling user interactions. The frontend can be part of a backend framework like Django or Flask using templating engines or can be developed using a frontend framework like React or Angular.
2. **Backend**: The backend is the server-side of the web application. It is responsible for processing requests from the frontend, interacting with the database, and returning responses to the frontend. The backend is developed using a backend framework like Django, Flask, or Express.js. 
3. **Database**: The database is a collection of data that is stored and managed by the web application. The database is used to store and retrieve data for the web application. The database can be a relational database like MySQL or PostgreSQL, a NoSQL database like MongoDB or Redis.
4. **API**: The API is the interface that allows the frontend to communicate with the backend. The API defines the endpoints that the frontend can use to interact with the backend. The API can be RESTful or GraphQL.
5. **Containerization**: Containerization is the process of packaging an application and its dependencies into a container. Containers are lightweight, portable, and isolated environments that can run on any platform. Containerization allows developers to build, ship, and run applications consistently across different environments.
6. **Orchestration**: Orchestration is the process of managing and coordinating containers in a distributed environment. Orchestration tools like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm are used to deploy, scale, and manage containers in a production environment.
7. **CI/CD**: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) is the practice of automating the process of building, testing, and deploying applications. CI/CD pipelines are used to automate the development and deployment process, ensuring that changes are tested and deployed quickly and reliably.
8. **Version Control**: Version control is the practice of tracking and managing changes to source code. Version control systems like Git are used to track changes, collaborate with other developers, and manage codebases.

((Backend + Database) -> API -> Frontend) -> Containerization -> Orchestration -> CI/CD

## In this repository we want to take a look at the following technologies and tools:
1. **Frontend**: 
    - Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
    - CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS
    - JavaScript frameworks like Node.js, Next.js
2. **Backend**:
    - WSGI vs ASGI
    - Django
    - Flask
    - Express.js
3. **Database**:
    - MySQL
    - PostgreSQL
    - MongoDB
    - Redis
4. **API**:
    - RESTful API
    - GraphQL
5. **Containerization**:
    - Docker
6. **Orchestration**:
    - Kubernetes
    - Docker Swarm
7. **CI/CD**:
    - GitHub Actions
8. **Version Control**:
    - Git
9. **Reverse Proxy**:
    - Nginx
    - Apache2
